# Analysis and Prediction of MNIST Dataset

![MNIST Dataset](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/27/MnistExamples.png)

## Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that explores the famous MNIST dataset, a collection of handwritten digits widely used in the field of machine learning. The goal is to analyze the dataset and implement predictive models using XGBoost, Decision Tree, and Logistic Regression algorithms.

## Dataset

The MNIST dataset consists of 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits (0 through 9), making it a classic dataset for image classification tasks. The dataset is widely used to benchmark machine learning algorithms.

You can find the MNIST dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hojjatk/mnist-dataset).

## Notebooks

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- In the `EDA` section of the notebook, I perform an exploratory data analysis to understand the characteristics of the MNIST dataset. This includes visualizing sample images, examining the distribution of digit classes, and exploring key statistics.

### 2. Data Preprocessing

- The `Data Preprocessing` section covers the necessary steps to prepare the dataset for model training. This includes reshaping the images, normalizing pixel values, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.

### 3. XGBoost Model

- The `XGBoost Model` section implements the XGBoost algorithm for digit classification. Hyperparameter tuning and performance evaluation metrics are also included.

### 4. Decision Tree Model

- The `Decision Tree Model` section focuses on training a Decision Tree classifier for the MNIST dataset. The model's accuracy and other relevant metrics are reported.

### 5. Logistic Regression Model

- In the `Logistic Regression Model` section, a logistic regression classifier is trained and evaluated. The notebook includes insights into the model's performance and any relevant observations.
